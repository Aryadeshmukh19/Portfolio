        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Arya Deshmukh, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Big Data Analytics.
            Driven, adaptable, and always eager to learn, I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge me to innovate and grow. 
            With hands-on experience in data analysis, backend development, and graphic design, I continuously seek opportunities to expand 
            my skill set. My journey includes internships in business development and digital marketing, where I gained valuable industry 
            exposure and honed my strategic thinking.
            <br><br>
            Beyond academics, I actively engage in technical communities and leadership roles. As the Co-lead of Codezilla, an open-source 
            club affiliated with Mozilla, I foster collaboration and skill development among aspiring developers.
            <br><br>
            I've competed in prestigious hackathons like Pragyan (NIT Trichy), IBM Z-Datathon, IIITDM Vashisht, and SRM Ideathon, where I put 
            my problem-solving and teamwork skills to the test. From developing an AI-powered tumor detection system to creating a social media 
            platform for pet lovers, I am committed to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find 
            me exploring design, freelancing, or refining my data visualization skills with Power BI.
        </p>
